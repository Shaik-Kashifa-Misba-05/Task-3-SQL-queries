# Task-3-SQL-queries
# Parks and Recreation SQL Practice

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly SQL queries based on a fictional **Parks and Recreation** employee database. The queries demonstrate key SQL concepts such as SELECT statements, filtering, grouping, ordering, subqueries, views, and indexing.

## 📋 Tables Used

- `employee_demographics`: Basic employee info (name, age, gender, etc.)
- `employee_salary`: Employee salary, job titles, and department IDs
- `parks_departments`: Department ID and name mapping

## 🧪 Query Categories

### 🔍 Basic SELECT Queries
- View all employee data
- Perform column calculations
- Use `DISTINCT` to show unique values

### 🎯 WHERE Clause (Filtering)
- Filter employees by salary, age, gender, etc.
- Use conditions like `=`, `!=`, `>`, `BETWEEN`, `AND`, `OR`

### 📊 GROUP BY and Aggregates
- Group data by gender or occupation
- Use functions like `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`

### 📋 ORDER BY (Sorting)
- Sort employee data by gender and age
- Use column names or positions for ordering

### 🔁 Subqueries
- Use subqueries in `WHERE` and `SELECT` to compare and filter data

### 👁️ Views
- Create virtual tables to simplify complex queries:
  - Basic employee info view
  - High earners view
  - Department salary summary view

### ⚡ Indexing and Performance
- Create indexes on frequently filtered columns
- Use `EXPLAIN` to see if an index is being used
